YoNTMA
======

YoNTMA (You'll Never Take Me Alive!) is a tool designed to enhance the protection of data encryption on Windows laptops. A Macintosh version is available [here](https://github.com/iSECPartners/yontma-mac).

## This fork does the following

- Forces shutdown instead of hibernating

How It Works
------------

YoNTMA runs as a Win32 service on BitLocker-protected laptops. If the laptop is disconneted from AC power or wired Ethernet while the screen is locked, YoNTMA puts the system into hibernate. This prevents a laptop thief from accessing your encrypted data later via a DMA attack while the machine is still powered on and the encryption keys are in memory.

How to Run
----------

From an elevated cmd prompt, run:

<pre>yontma -i</pre>

to install and run the YoNTMA service.

If you open services.msc, you will find You'll Never Take Me Alive! (YoNTMA) in the list running as a service.

To tell yontma to install even if it does not detect BitLocker (for example if you use Truecrypt) run:

<pre>yontma -i -f</pre>

Requirements
-------------

The machine must be Windows Vista or above and have BitLocker Drive Encryption enabled on the OS volume (typically drive C:).

If BitLocker is not enabled, yontma must be `--force`-ed on with the `-f` or `--force` option.

Build Instructions
------------------

YoNTMA builds in Visual Studio (as well as the free version, VS Express 2012 for Desktop) and has no outside dependencies. Open yontma.sln to build.
